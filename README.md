This is the homepage for the project Elements. 

For a more detailed developer documentation please refer [here](https://elementsproject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). The research paper behind this project can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07691)

## Overview
 
Elements introduces for the first time the power of the Entity-Component-System (ECS) with the versatility of Scenegraphs, in the context of Computer Graphics (CG), Deep Learning (DL) for Scientific Visualization (SciViz). It also aims to provide the basic tools to anyone that wants to be involved with basic Computer Graphics as well as advanced topics such as Geometric Deep Learning, Geometric Algebra and many many more.

Following a modern educational approach, all related packages are in the Python programming language.

## Packages Involved in Elements

* pyECSS: A package for applying ECS to any Scenegraph
* pyGLV : A package applying ECSS to CG, DL and SciViz problems
* pyEEL : A learning hub for various topics where ECSS can be applied
